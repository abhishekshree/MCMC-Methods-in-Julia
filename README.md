### Work done before:

- __Assignment 1__: Understood methods to generate samples in case of discrete distributions like Accept-Reject, Inverse-Transform, etc.
- __Assignment 2__: Understood methods to generate samples in case of continuous distributions and some miscellaneous methods. Proved the correctness of the Bernoulli Factories.
- __Assignment 3__: Worked on Importance Sampling Methods, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Regression, Bayesian Models and Acceptance-Reject for Bayesian Models.
- __Assignment 4__: Worked on understanding the mathematics behind Markov Chains, MCMC, Metropolis-Hastings, and Introductory Measure Theory. Implemented the MH algorithm for various distributions.
- __Assignment 5__: Learnt about Stochastic Processes and Stability, different MH Algorithms, and Gibbs Sampling. Summarized and implemented portions of the paper titled [Efficient Bernoulli factory MCMC for intractable posteriors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07471) consisting of the Barker's Method and portkey Barker's algorithms (computationally more efficient that the current state-of-the-art).
